# Augmentation using Albumentation

- Data Augmentation : A Technique in machine learning used to reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model, by training models on several slightly-modified copies of existing data.
- Albumentation : A computer vision tool that boosts the performance of deep convolutional neural networks.
